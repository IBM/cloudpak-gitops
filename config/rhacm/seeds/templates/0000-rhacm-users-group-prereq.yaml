# Note that I tried to created this group via declarative approach but, at least as of
# version 2.3.7, Argo overrides the "users" field of the group, effectively removing
# users manually added to it, despite our best efforts to set the appropriate
# "ignoreDifferences" and "RespectIgnoreDifferences" in the respective "Application"
# resource.
#
# If that situation ever changes, remove this Job and add a new YAML for the
# resource in the repo
